# ChainHopper Protocol SDK

[ChainHopper Protocol](https://github.com/meliopolis/chainhopper-protocol) allows Uniswap v3 and v4 LP positions to migrate between supported chains with a single click.

Supports:

- One-click migration from any v3/v4 pool to any v3/v4 pool
- Smart bridging: Single or Dual Token migrations
- Native token support for v4
- Initialize new pools through the migration, if needed
- Live on: Mainnet, Unichain, Base, Arbitrum, Optimism

We are grateful to [Uniswap Foundation](https://www.uniswapfoundation.org/) for funding and support!

## Why use ChainHopper?

To move an LP position to another chain, it takes 4-5 manual steps:

1. Remove liquidity & collect fees
2. Swap/bridge "other" token
3. Bridge WETH [Wait for confirmations...]
4. Swap back, if needed
5. Mint new position

Plus: you need gas tokens on destination chain ðŸ˜«.

With ChainHopper, you can do all this with one transaction.

Use this Typescript SDK to quickly and integrate with ChainHopper protocol with a few lines of code.

## Installation

```
bun install chainhopper-sdk viem
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Setup the ChainHopperClient

```typescript
import { ChainHopperClient } from 'chainhopper-sdk';

export const client = ChainHopperClient.create({
  rpcUrls: {
    1: Bun.env.MAINNET_RPC_URL,
    10: Bun.env.OPTIMISM_RPC_URL,
    130: Bun.env.UNICHAIN_RPC_URL,
    8453: Bun.env.BASE_RPC_URL,
    42161: Bun.env.ARBITRUM_RPC_URL,
  },
});
```

### 2. Retrieve Migration Data

The SDK provides two main ways to retrieve migration data:

1. **Find the Best Migration Path**: Use `requestMigration()` to find the optimal migration path based on your preferences
2. **Request a Specific Migration Method**: Use `requestExactMigration()` when you want to specify the exact migration method and parameters

#### 2.1 Find the Best Migration Path

Use `requestMigration()` when you want to find the optimal migration path based on your preferences. This method uses an optional `PathFilter` to specify your requirements while allowing the SDK to find the best available options.

In this example, we skip `PathFilter` altogether to let the SDK find the best path.

```typescript
import { RequestMigrationParams, Protocol, chainConfigs } from 'chainhopper-sdk';
import { zeroAddress } from 'viem';

const migrationParams: RequestMigrationParams = {
  sourcePosition: {
    chainId: 8453, // Base
    protocol: Protocol.UniswapV3,
    tokenId: 1806423n,
  },
  destination: {
    chainId: 130, // Unichain
    token0: zeroAddress, // native ETH
    token1: chainConfigs[130].usdcAddress,
    fee: 500,
    tickSpacing: 10,
    hooks: zeroAddress,
    tickLower: -250000,
    tickUpper: -150000,
  },
};

const migrationResponse = await client.requestMigration(migrationParams);
```

The response will include:
- `migrations`: Array of available migrations sorted by highest to lowest expected value
- `unavailableMigrations`: Migrations that match your filter but aren't currently available, with reasons why

If you want to narrow down specific path, you can add:

```typescript
const migrationParams: RequestMigrationParams = {
  sourcePosition: {
    chainId: 8453, // Base
    protocol: Protocol.UniswapV3,
    tokenId: 1806423n,
  },
  destination: {
    // same as above
  },
  path: {
    bridgeType: BridgeType.Across, // narrows to Across
    migrationMethod: MigrationMethod.SingleToken, // narrows to SingleToken
    slippageInBps: 50, // sets slippage, default at 100
  }
};
```


#### 2.2 Request a Specific Migration Method

Use `requestExactMigration` when you want to specify the exact migration method and parameters. This is useful when you need precise control over the migration process.

```typescript
import { RequestExactMigrationParams, Protocol, chainConfigs } from 'chainhopper-sdk';

const exactMigrationParams: RequestExactMigrationParams = {
  sourcePosition: {
    chainId: 8453,
    protocol: Protocol.UniswapV3,
    tokenId: 1806423n,
  },
  destination: {
    chainId: 130,
    token0: zeroAddress,
    token1: chainConfigs[130].usdcAddress,
    fee: 500,
    tickSpacing: 10,
    hooks: zeroAddress,
    tickLower: -250000,
    tickUpper: -150000,
  },
  exactPath: { // required for ExactMigrations
    bridgeType: BridgeType.Across,
    migrationMethod: MigrationMethod.SingleToken,
    slippageInBps: 50,
  },
};

const exactMigrationResponse = await client.requestExactMigration(exactMigrationParams);
```

The response will contain a single migration that exactly matches your specified parameters. If no matching migration is available, it will throw an exception.

#### Additional Options

For both methods, you can also request multiple migrations at once using:
- `requestMigrations`: For multiple destinations with path filters
- `requestExactMigrations`: For multiple destinations with exact paths

See the [Advanced Options](#advanced-options) section for more details on customizing your migration requests.

### 3. Execute the Migration

You can execute the migration by using the data returned from either the general or exact migration requests:

```typescript
import { createWalletClient, simulateContract, writeContract } from 'viem';
import { base } from 'viem/chains';
import { config } from './config';
import { NFTSafeTransferFrom } from 'chainhopper-sdk';

export const walletClient = createWalletClient({
  chain: base,
  transport: custom(window.ethereum!),
});

// Select a migration from the migrationResponse:
const migration = migrationResponse.migrations[0];
// migrations are sorted by highest to lowest expected value of the destination

// If needed, inspect unavailableMigrations to show migrations matching pathFilter
// but not currently available with the reasons why they are not available:
console.log(migrationResponse.unavailableMigrations);

const { request } = await walletClient.simulateContract({
  ...migration.executionParams,
  account: migrationResponse.sourcePosition.owner,
});

// execute the request
const result = await writeContract(config, request);
```


For exact migration, only one migration is available:

```typescript
const { request: exactRequest } = await walletClient.simulateContract({
  ...exactMigrationResponse.migration.executionParams,
  account: exactMigrationResponse.sourcePosition.owner,
});

// execute the exact request
const exactResult = await writeContract(config, exactRequest);

// Select a migration from the migrationsResponse:
const migration = migrationsResponse.migrations[0][0];
// for a migration request with multiple destinations, outputs are grouped
// per destination (and sorted by value per requested destination)

const { request: selectedMigration } = await walletClient.simulateContract({
  ...migration.executionParams,
  account: migrationsResponse.sourcePosition.owner,
});

// execute the selected migration
const exactResult = await writeContract(config, selectedMigration);
```

Calling `writeContract` opens up a wallet window for signing the transaction and initiating the migration process.

## Advanced Options

### Sender Fees

ChainHopper protocol charges a 10bps (0.1%) fee for any completed migration. Additionally, integrators can specify their own fees, which the protocol will split with a percentage going to the specified recipient.

```typescript
const migrationParams: RequestMigrationParams = {
  // ... previous params
  senderShareBps: 15,
  senderFeeRecipient: '0x...', // address for fee recipient
};
```

### Migration Methods: Single Token vs Dual Token

ChainHopper Protocol supports two migration methods:

- **Single Token**: Converts the entire position to WETH (or USDC), migrates it, and then swaps back to the other token at the destination.
- **Dual Token**: Moves both tokens independently, reconstructing the position at the destination.

For example, to request a Dual Token route use `pathFilter` or `exactPath` to speciy it:

```typescript
const migrationParams: RequestMigrationParams = {
  sourcePosition: {
    // ... source position info
  },
  destination: {
    // ... destination info
  },
  path: {
    migrationMethod: MigrationMethod.DualToken, // specify DualToken
  },
  // ... rest of params
};
```

### Slippage Parameters

By default, the SDK allows for 1% slippage, divided evenly across the source and destination chains. You can adjust this by specifying the `slippageInBps` parameter:

```typescript
const migrationParams: RequestMigrationParams = {
  // ... previous params
  path: { // or exactPath
    // ... other params
    slippageInBps: 100, // allows for up to 1% slippage
  },
};
```

### Creating a New Pool

ChainHopper Protocol (the smart contracts) supports creating a pool if it doesn't exist already. If you want to do this, you can specify a `sqrtPriceX96` to initialize the new pool and a new pool will be initialized with this price to support the migration:

```typescript
const migrationParams: RequestMigrationParams = {
  sourcePosition: {
    // ... source position info
  },
  destination: {
    // ... other destination info
    // specifying sqrtPriceX96 will initialize a new pool at this price:
    sqrtPriceX96: 736087614829673861315061733n,
  },
  path: {
    // ... path filter
  },
  // ... rest of params
};
```

## FAQs

_1. What chains are supported?_

Currently, we support Ethereum, Optimism, Arbitrum, Base and Unichain. Please get in touch if you want us to support additional chains.

_2. Do you have plans to support additional bridges?_

Currently, we only support Across. We are considering adding Wormhole and Native Interop. If you have a request, please let us know.

_3. What types of pools or tokens are supported?_

Besides Fee-on-transfer and rebasing tokens, we support all tokens.

For pools, as long as there is a bridgeable asset in a pool, we can support it. Though, we caution users when using any pool with hooks, as those can lead to unpredictable scenarios.

_4. Is this protocol Audited?_

Yes. You can find the audit reports in protocol repository: [ChainHopper Protocol](https://github.com/meliopolis/chainhopper-protocol).

_5. How long does a migration typically take?_

Most migrations with reasonable slippage (~1%) finish within 10 seconds.

_6. How do fees work?_

You, as the interface, can specify a fee and a recipient address to share that fee with. The protocol takes a 0.1% fee and additionally takes a 15% cut of the interface fee. So, if you specified 0.15% as the interface fee, the user will pay 0.25% which will be split 0.1225% for protocol and 0.1275% for you.

_7. What happens if migration fails midway?_

If migration fails on the source chain, nothing happens. User still owns the LP token and can retry.

If migration fails on the destination chian, the bridged asset will be delivered to the user's wallet **on destination chain**. And we will not take any fees for a failed migration.

In extremely rare scenarios, it's possible that an Across relayer was unable to deliver the asset on destination chain. In those situations, the attempted bridged asset - ETH, WETH, USDC - will be returned to the user _on source chain_.
